This project is a simple React application that implements a basic counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionalities. The component, created using the Component class, maintains a count state that is updated based on user interactions. The count increases when the mouse hovers over the "Add (➕)" button and decreases when hovering over the "Sub (➖)" button. Additionally, a "Reset" button allows the user to reset the count to zero.
